## Project Summary

Our group had the idea of a meme creator where you could download the meme of your choosing. With the prevalent spread of the internet in the early 21st century, our group had the idea to invent a meme creator where you could unleaash your creativity.

## My Feature

My feature is a database of all the images and their base64 encryption key. When a user creates a meme and publishes it to the database, it is stored here and can then be used by other users.

## Componenet A: Program Code

| CollegeBoard Requirement | What I did |
|------------------|------------------|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file.  | Our project takes an image, top text, and bottom text from the user.  |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose.  | An example of collection of data in our project is the collection of memes on the backend that gets updated whenever the user adds a meme to it. We use this database so that the users can access all the memes and can download them or view them.  |
| At least one procedure that contirubted to the programâ€™s intened purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:  | The procedure name(meme_maker), a return(image), and paramaters(image, top_text, bottom_text, font_path='impact.ttf', font_size=40) <a href="https://ibb.co/F8SzQq1"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/h2PVG1N/Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-33-27-AM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-33-27-AM" border="0"></a> |
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure  | Image shows sequencing, selection, and iteration through a list of meme images <a href="https://ibb.co/Zg02DK5"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3FnRZW2/sequencing.png" alt="sequencing" border="0"></a>  |
| Calls to your student-developed prodcedure:  | This calls queryImages <a href="https://ibb.co/vzK055m"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DKS0XXk/Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-03-13-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-03-13-PM" border="0"></a>  |
| Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality  | This code displays the image with the given top and bottom text from the user <a href="https://ibb.co/mbJBghZ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ckJvV2f/Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-10-19-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-26-at-9-10-19-PM" border="0"></a>  |
