## Group Work:

My group and I collaborated and communicated what we wanted in our project to achieve goals that were reasonable. We created a discussion board to keep up on our progress throughout the trimester. This allowed us to keep up pace with our project.

## Progress Issue

[ToDo List](https://github.com/users/Imaad08/projects/1)

## CPT Project Feature:

My feature shows the memes in the meme gallery after they are added to the database. The user can see memes added to the public database by other users. This gallery displays all of the memes that were added to it in a clear format.

## Meeting College Board Requirements:

## Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file

Our project takes an image, top text, and bottom text from the user.

## Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose.

An example of collection of data in our project is the collection of memes on the backend that gets updated whenever the user adds a meme to it. We use this database so that the users can access all the memes and can download them or view them.

## At least one procedure that contirubted to the program’s intened purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:

The procedure name(meme_maker), a return(image), and paramaters(image, top_text, bottom_text, font_path=’impact.ttf’, font_size=40)
