    "### Crowdsourcing\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is the action of acquirring work and information from a large group of people via the internet. This information can be obtained from social media and other forms of media throughout the internet. Crowdsourcing allows companies to work with people throughout the world and aquire a variety of different skills. \n",

    "# benefits of crowdsourcing\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is cost efficent because it allows access to talented workers without the need for a traditional workforce. Also, projects and work can be completed in a lesser amount of time due to the many contributors. Finally, the diversity of contributors can lead to innovative ideas and solutions that may have not emerged in a traditional setting. \n",

    "# Homework\n",
    "## Question 1  \n",
    "Explain the concept of crowdsourcing. Provide examples of how it is commonly used in different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crowdsourcing is the process of getting input by soliciting inputs from a big group of people. This uses collective intelligence and a diverse group of people to generate ideas. It is commonly used in open source software development, citizen science, and data annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2  \n",
    "Discuss the benefits and challenges associated with crowdsourcing. How can organizations effectively harness the power of crowdsourcing while mitigating potential drawbacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of crowdsourcing includes allowing a diverse expertise, being cost effective, and getting faster results. Some drawbacks of crowdsourcing include quality control, security, and bias/manipulation. Organizations can harness the power of crowdsourcing by insuring there are quality control mechanisms that don't allow faulty data. They can also have clear guidelines and insructions which helps maintain the quality of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3  \n",
    "Identify a real-world example of a successful crowdsourcing project. Explain the project, its goals, and the positive outcomes achieved through the collaboration of a large group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable example of a successful crowdsourcing project is Foldit. The primary goal of Foldit was to find how protein folding works. Foldit transformed this into a game allowing players to make protein folding into a puzzle game. One positive outcome of this was in 2011 when gamers found a solution to the structure of a protein related to the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. This game also led to the acceleration of research on the protein folding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "Create a hypothetical scenario where crowdsourcing could be applied to solve a specific problem. Describe the problem, the type of contributions you would seek from the crowd, and the potential impact of implementing the crowdsourced solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that in a city there is a lot of traffic congestion and inefficient public transportation. The contribution from the crowd would be to analyze the traffic paterns within the city. Using data provided by the city, citizens can analyze peak traffic hours and areas without optimal traffic flow. The potential impact is that this would lead to evidence based decision making for transportation management."
