    "\n",
    "Throughout this trimester, I've learned several things that range from how to create a plan for a project to getting JSON data from a backend repository via an API. Some positive accomplishments I've had include figuring out how to connect a frontend and backend repository using the fetch command. I also got hands on experience with HTML, JavaScript, and Python which helped advance me in my knowledge of coding. Also, I learned what an API was and how to work with it which is probably going to be helpful for my future. Some opportunities for growth I have is learning how to design the frontend of a website better using HTML. While I got the basic design for a website, I would like to further my knowledge and dive further into the topic. I hope to learn more about APIs work and how the fetch command work because I find it fascinating that we can get data from one place and transfer it to another. This is my trimester one reflection.\n"
